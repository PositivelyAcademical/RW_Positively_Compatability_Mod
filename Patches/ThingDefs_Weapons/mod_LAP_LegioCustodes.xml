                        <description>The sentinel warbled is unique weapon of the Legio Custodes, brutal where the guardian spear is precise. The hyper-pulse disruption field generators found in the warblade are able to tear apart flesh and metal on contact, while inbuilt into the blade is a double-barrelled bolt caster able to lay down a hail of fire at short range.\n\nThe warriors of the Legio Custodes are uniquely created, genetically engineered living weapons, superhuman in physical and mental prowess and skilled in battle beyond even the warriors of the Legiones Astartes. Their martial arts are also singular and centred on individual combat, where one Custodian might slaughter dozens of lesser opponents with blinding speed and slay would-be assassins and champions with contemptuous ease.</description>
