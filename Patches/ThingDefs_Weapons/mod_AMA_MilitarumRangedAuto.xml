                        <description>Heavy stubber is the name given to a range of heavy-barrelled auto weapons used for sustained fire. Like autoguns they are easily manufactured and maintained, and are commonly used by forces across the Imperium. A mainstay support weapon on backwater planets that cannot maintain laser weapons in working order due to technological or resource limitations, and also popular with outlaws and hive gangers, the heavy stubber is ideal for fighting off large numbers of enemies or even lightly armoured vehicles. Its high rate of fire makes up for its modest strength and armour-piercing abilities.\n\nThe Agripinaa pattern heavy stubber was originally issued to the Imperial Army, and continues to be issued to the Astra Militarum and Planetary Defence Force militias.</description>
