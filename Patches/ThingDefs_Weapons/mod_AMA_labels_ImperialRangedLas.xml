                        <description>The Lasgun, also sometimes referred to as a Lasrifle, is a directed-energy antipersonnel weapon used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man, and it is the most common and widely-used type of laser weapon in the galaxy. Lasguns are reliable, easy to maintain and to produce, and are readily available on most Imperial worlds. The Lasgun is strong enough to take an ordinary human arm off with one shot but is not as effective against the more durable alien bodies and stronger types of personal armour. A Lasgun's beam also cauterizes the wounds it inflicts due to the immense heat given off by the shot.\n\nAlthough thousands of variant models, marks and patterns exist the standard Lasgun pattern used by the Imperial Guard is the M35 "M-Galaxy" Lasgun, first put into use in M35.789.2546</description>

It also has a slightly reduced effective range offset against an increased rate of fire, hence it being favoured in dense jungle environs frequented by the Catachan regigments.</description>

                        <description>The Lascarbine is a carbine form of the standard Imperial Lasgun that is easier to carry and to aim that its larger counterpart. It will often possess a folding stock to further optimise its size. However, as a result of these modificatios, a Lascarbine has a shorter effective range and will fire fewer shots before depleting its power pack when compared to the standard Lasgun.\n\nWhile technically a Lascarbine, the Voss Pattern Lasgun is the standard weapon issued to the Steel Legion regiments of the Astra Militrarum raised from Armageddon (known during the Heresy-era, and prior to its relocation, as Ullanor).</description>

                        <description>While the term Lasrifle is often used interchangeably to mean Lasgun, weapons designated as such can be larger and more cumbersome than the more typical patterns of Imperial Lasguns. As a result of these differences, a true Lasrifle has a longer range and hits harder than the standard Lasgun, though this also means it can fire fewer shots before depleting its power pack.\n\nThe Lucius No.28 Pattern Lasgun is is the signature weapon of the Death Korps of Krieg. It operates in the 21 megathoule range, but is designed to draw from a standard Munitorum-issue power pack. Consequently, the Lucius lasgun discharges a more powerful shot, but drains the power pack at a correspondingly increased rate. This also puts a great strain on the weapon, limiting the rate of fire and requiring such features as additional heat sink rings lining the exterior of the barrel. Even with such considerations, an over-taxed Lucius lasgun can quickly overheat.</description>

                        <description>The Lasgun, also sometimes referred to as a Lasrifle, is a directed-energy antipersonnel weapon used by the military forces of the Imperium of Man, and it is the most common and widely-used type of laser weapon in the galaxy. Lasguns are reliable, easy to maintain and to produce, and are readily available on most Imperial worlds. The Lasgun is strong enough to take an ordinary human arm off with one shot but is not as effective against the more durable alien bodies and stronger types of personal armour. A Lasgun's beam also cauterizes the wounds it inflicts due to the immense heat given off by the shot.\n\nThe Mars Pattern Lasgun is the Lasgun pattern used by the regiments of the Jouran Dragoons and the Tallarn Desert Raiders.</description>
