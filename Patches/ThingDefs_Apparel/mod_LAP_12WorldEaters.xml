                        <description>The Butcher's Nails were the psycho-surgery conducted on the world of Nuceria, implanted into the brain of the Primarch Angron while he fought as a slave. Numerous nails trailed with cables which resemble dreadlocks were inserted through skull and into the brain to amplify the anger and rage of the subject.\n\nAngron, most bloody-handed and savage of the Primarchs, was the master of the World Eaters Legion. In his youth cast upon a world of brutal oppression he was enslaved and surgically mutilated to become a gladiator in the games of death, where he became the undefeated lord of the red sands, a killer without peer. After leading a doomed slave revolt the Emperor saved him from dying with his rebellion and placed him at the head of his Legion.</description>
