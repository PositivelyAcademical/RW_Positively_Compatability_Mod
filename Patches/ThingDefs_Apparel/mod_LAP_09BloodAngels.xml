                        <description>Thought to have been wrought by the Emperor's own hand, Sanguinius' ornately decorated suit of golden armour was designed with both function and form in mind, allowing him to move freely in flight while providing superlative protection. Sanguinius' wings, too, are so natural an extension of his form that he can use them to great advantage in combat, swooping away from enemy lunges or turning blades on his pinions.\n\nOften considered to be the greatest of his kin, Sanguinius is a peerless warrior, masterful strategist and beloved hero of the Imperium. Among the Primarchs, there were few who would speak ill of him, with even grim figure such as Perturabo and Ferrus Manus offering grudging praise of their winged brother.</description>
