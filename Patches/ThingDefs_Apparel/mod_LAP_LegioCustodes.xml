Like all the wargear of the Custodians, the Captain-General's helmet is fashioned from rare auramite alloy.\n\nConstantin Valdor sits at the right hand of the Emperor as perhaps His most trusted companion and guardian, a watchman of inviolable purpose and all but unmatched fighting skill. Such in fact is Valdor's martial power and superhuman physical and mental abilities that there are those, even within the Imperial Court, who have in whispers called him 'Primarch' in all but name.</description>
