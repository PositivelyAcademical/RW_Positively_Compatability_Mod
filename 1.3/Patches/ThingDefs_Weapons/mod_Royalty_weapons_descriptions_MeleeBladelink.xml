                <description>A crystal-metallic longsword infused with mechanites that maintain a mono-molecular cutting edge. It cuts through even thick armour with ease, while its light weight and onboard persona permit extremely fast attacks.\n\nThis weapon has an onboard persona that can bond to only a single person. The wielder and intelligent weapon can synchronize their reflexes and attack with frightening speed, accuracy, and creativity. Once bonded to a wielder, the weapon's persona will refuse to be wielded by anyone else.</description>
